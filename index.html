      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>
      The rapid iteration and proliferation of advances in the field of deep learning and artificial intelligence
      have led the world into a new era of data driven decision making which will likely only gain traction as algorithms
      become more robust and advanced. Along with the powerful forward momentum of machine learning research, there have also been
      numerous subfields which are developing at an ever increasing pace. Supervised learning has spawned self-supervised,
      semi-supervised, and unsupervised variants while meta learning has arisen to fill the need of quick adaptations from environments
      with limited context. In addition to theoretical research, there have been extraordinary advances in the ability to deploy production
      models with billions of parameters distributed across numerous nodes which has given new persepctive to the possible depths of
      deep learning.
      </p>

      <p>
      Our workshop aims to bring together top researchers working on cutting edge advances across
      every subfield of the machine learning community. We believe that every opportunity to meet (online or in person) to discuss relevant
      advances, engage in open discussion, and receive critical feedback is an invaluable resource to the community. We welcome and invite all
      researchers to be a part of our workshop.
      </p>
